In this project, the dataset was prepared using Roboflow, and models were trained using various YOLO variants, as well as the Florence and RT-DETR models.

Due to industry constraints, I'm unable to provide the full codebase for this project. However, the following components were integral to the work:

Dataset Preparation: Utilized Roboflow for data annotation and augmentation.
Models Trained: Various YOLO variants, Florence, and RT-DETR.
